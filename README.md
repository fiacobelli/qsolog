# qsolog
QSO Logging app

There are four kinds of files here:
- Python files (programs: Models, views, controllers)
- Config files: comma separated files with configuration options.
- UI file: qsologmainwindow.ui can be opened and edited with QT6 studio
- qsomain.py: Technically a python file, but needs to be generated with `pyuic qsologmainwindow.ui -o qsomain.py`
